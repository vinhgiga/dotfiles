# Dotfiles

## Installation

**Warning**: If you want to give these dotfiles a try, you should first fork this repository, review the code, and remove things you don’t want or need. Don’t blindly use my settings unless you know what that entails. Use at your own risk!

You can clone the repository wherever you want. The `setup.sh` script will pull in the latest version and copy the files to your home folder.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/vinhgiga/dotfiles.git && cd dotfiles && source setup.sh
```
